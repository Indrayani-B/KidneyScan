# 🩺 Kidney Disease Classification using Deep Learning

An end-to-end Deep Learning project for **classifying kidney diseases from CT scan images**.
The model predicts one of the following classes:

- **Cyst**
- **Tumor**
- **Stone**
- **Normal**

This project is designed with **research, reproducibility, and deployment** in mind.
